# linusthe.dev

I made this website to test and play around with different things. [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/) is used so that i can easily use different components of different frame works in one page.

## How to run

I use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as a package manager.

```bash
# install dependencies
pnpm install

# run locally
pnpm dev
```
